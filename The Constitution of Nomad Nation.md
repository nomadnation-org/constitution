# Nomad Nation Constitution

## Preamble

The purpose of Nomad Nation is to further the business of all its solopreneur members. We believe that assembling like-minded solopreneur business owners under the same roof, great things can be achieved. Alignment of interests and resource pooling within a community can make being a global solopreneur simpler and cheaper and more flexible than each solopreneur doing business separately.

At its core Nomad Nation is about independence and freedom. Therefore, we are regulating as little as possible. Instead, our community is built on mutual trust. Trust is what allows Nomad Nation and its members to reduce bureaucracy dramatically.

We want to make Nomad Nation a safe place for everyone to run his/her own global solopreneur business - while at the same being part of a supporting community. Such "cobusiness" of course can only work if all its members keep an open mind and act responsibly for themselves and also the community as a whole.

## Membership

1. Nomad Nation is offering various ways to become a member. All are similar in that a member's business is done with Nomad Nation as the formal outside contractual partner of customers and suppliers.
2. Members pay a membership fee to cover basic services of Nomad Nation and the operational expenses of the organisation.

## Responsibilities and Liability

1. Even though Nomad Nation is the outward facing contractual partner, the member stays fully responsible for all transactions regarding his/her business. 
2. Nomad Nation does not take interest in the businesses of its members. All members are separately responsible for the development and wellbeing of their businesses.
3. Members shall act responsibly in the spirit of an [Honourable Merchant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honourable_Merchant).
4. Members shall not conduct "questionable business" posing a risk to the member community.
5. Business conduct perceived as irresponsible by Nomad Nation can result in a cancellation of the membership. Such cancellation is purely a means of self-protection of the whole community and will be deceived by all non-involved shareholders of Nomad Nation.
6. All members are collectively liable with the assets acquired through Nomad Nation and the balance on their membership bank account.
7. No individual member shall take risks at the expense of Nomad Nation and its community.
